# Vive Tutorial

This repo contains finished tutorial extensions.

## Vive Grabbing Tutorial
My start on the documentation for this is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-JDBz6dvpsyVxFFUQAV5lVZjokL_MqLbzepAquZmSqU/edit#

This branch contains the finished product of the tutorial. 

For this tutorial I refactored the player model from the initial Vive tutorial a fair amount to give a better unity hierarchy among other changes. There should only be a couple of minor changes to propagate back through the initial tutorial which I'll find and report in the next few days.

## Vive Audio Streaming and VoIP Tutorial
